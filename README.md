# Wordle

I independently developed a unique algorithm for a Python-based game application, drawing inspiration from the popular New York Times Wordle game. My role primarily focused on the core logic and functionality of the game, where I leveraged my programming skills to create engaging and challenging gameplay. Working in the Python programming language, I utilized Visual Studio Code as my integrated development environment (IDE), which offered a robust platform for writing, testing, and debugging the code.

During this project, I collaborated closely with my professor, who contributed significantly by designing and implementing the graphical user interface (GUI). This collaboration was instrumental in bridging the gap between the algorithmic backend and the user-facing frontend of the application. The GUI designed by my professor not only made the game visually appealing but also intuitive for users, enhancing the overall gaming experience.

The development process involved iterative testing and refinement of the game mechanics, ensuring that the gameplay was both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, akin to the experience offered by the New York Times Wordle game. Our goal was to create a game that not only captured the essence of Wordleâ€™s word-puzzle challenge but also introduced unique elements that set our application apart.

This project was a significant learning experience, allowing me to deepen my understanding of Python programming and game development while also providing the opportunity to work in a collaborative environment with a focus on both technical and design aspects. The successful implementation of the game demonstrated my ability to develop complex algorithms and collaborate effectively to bring a software project to fruition.
